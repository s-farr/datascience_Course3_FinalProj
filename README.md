The script "run_analysis.R" assumes you have downloaded the UCI HAR Dataset from the weblink that can be found in the code book. It will run from within the same directory as the Dataset. The script will load in the appropriate datasets, reformat data if necessary, merge the datasets, extract the mean and standard deviation per trial, and will output a CSV file in the same directory containing the averages for the means and standard deviations per subject per activity.
